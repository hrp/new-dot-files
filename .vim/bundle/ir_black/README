This is a fork of Infinite Red's excellent vim theme:

http://blog.infinitered.com/entries/show/8

Original author is Todd Werth.

Forked and rearranged dirs to enable this to be fetched with the Tammer Saleh's excellent update_bundles script and Pathogen.vim:

See zip-enabled version of update_bundles:
http://gist.github.com/414542#file_update_bundles

To use this, add the GIT url to update_bundles or manually drop the ir_black.vim file in here:

  ~/.vim/colors/ir_black.vim

And then add this line to your .vimrc:

  :colorscheme ir_black

By the way, it doesn't look bad on a white background, either.
